The average person is familiar with space and time. The space has three dimensions and time has one.
So far so good. Having four space dimensions is so uncommon that the [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) often ends up in [Sci-Fi movies](https://marvel-movies.fandom.com/wiki/Tesseract).
Likewise, a second time dimension seems unnecessary.
When computer systems need proper accounting and history management, an additional dimension is indispensable.
I have met many people who struggle to grasp the concept of it and are too shy to ask for clarification.
That's why I have created this info-graphic. Digest this difficult topic in private at your own pace. Enjoy.
